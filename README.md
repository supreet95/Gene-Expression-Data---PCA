# Gene-Expression-Data---PCA
Identify potentially mislabeled samples using PCA on data with 5000 gene expressions for Leukemia

We performed a standard Principal Component Analysis on the 38 samples, across all the 5k genes, to understand which of these genes 
are most useful in identifying the type of Leukemia. As a result of this analysis, we were able to extract maximum possible information 
from all the variables (genes) and project it down to 2-D space, to visualize different types of Leukemia. 
We colored each sample based on the type of Leukemia. This allowed us to quickly spot potential issues.
